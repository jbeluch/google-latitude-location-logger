latitude.

This script is a free and easy way to track the approximate location of
any cellphone that can run google latitude.  Useful for those who tend
to "misplace" their cellphone a lot.  Figure out if you left your cell
at the bar last night, or if it just got kicked under your bed.

website badge in order to use this script.  The script pulls your 
coordinates and then using an address lookup service to get an
an approximate street address.
